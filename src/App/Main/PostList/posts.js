        fullDescription: "A Doctor Doom movie may happen after all, as Noah Hawley confirmed discussions are ongoing with Marvel Studios. The film has faced quite the battle in its journey to the screen. Hawley first announced he was writing the film back in 2017 when Fox owned the character. The script was nearly complete by June of the next year, and Hawley said that both he and Fox were happy with the result. However, the movie was then reportedly shelved leading up to the acquisition of Fox and its characters by Disney earlier this year. Hawley previously called the movie \"a mixture of genres,\" similar to how Captain America: The Winter Soldier was both a political thriller and a superhero movie. At the time, he also mentioned the film would grapple with Doom's morality and question whether he was really a hero or villain. Hawley also called Doom a \"fascinating and under-served character\" and said that his mission wasn't to reboot the Fantastic Four franchise, but rather focus on one character who hadn't been explored as much. As far as casting for the leading role, popular TV and movie villain Mads Mikkelsen threw his hat in the ring a couple of years ago.",

Whether or not you're a die-hard Thor fan, or even a Marvel reader, this event is not to be missed--which is why we're here to help with the ultimate War of The Realms Reading Guide and checklist, from start to finish.When the Dark Elf Malekith leads a devastating (and, initially, successful) invasion of Earth, leading an army made up of the worst killers who ever hated Earth or Asgard, the War of the Realms begins. The epic story that follows has been an unprecedented success for Marvel Comics. Most annual comic events struggle to land, and it's easy to see why: it requires a certain strategic skill to create a central narrative, with room for fresh and creative spinoffs and tie-ins. Fortunately, Thor writer Jason Aaron is one of the few comic book writers to possess that skill, making War of the Realms easily the most carefully-constructed event since 2006's landmark Civil War. And for many fans, it may just be the best event they've enjoyed to date.",

        shortDescription: "What happened to Los Pollos Hermanos by the end of Breaking Bad? We explore the fate of the fast-food chain and how Gus' death affected the business.",
        fullDescription: "Los Pollos Hermanos was the most popular eatery in Breaking Bad. Of course, the fast-food fried chicken restaurant also served as a front to Gus' meth business. Here's what happened to the restaurant by the end of the series.Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) co-founded Los Pollos Hermanos along with his business partner Maximino Arciniega in the '80s to cover up their dealings in the drug trade. Years later, the fast-food chain had expanded to 14 locations across the American southwest. The company was a subsidiary Madrigal Electromotive, who owned major stake into the chain. Gus eventually became the sole owner of the business and used his role to ramp up his meth distribution. Los Pollos Hermanos played a key role in Gus' illegal business dealings. He even used the company's trucks to transport his product (even though they were proven to be targets of Cartel thugs). As a way to hide his true identity as a drug kingpin, he often worked inside the flagship restaurant. Throughout Breaking Bad, and the prequel series Better Call Saul, Gus would usually request that his colleagues met him at the restaurant. Because of that, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), and Walter White (Bryan Cranston) were avid Los Pollos Hermanos visitors. Gus' thirst for power would go on to lead to his downfall and death in Breaking Bad season 4, but what happened to Los Pollos Hermanos after Gus' death? After Gus was killed, the DEA continued to investigate his empire. With nobody left to cover up Los Pollos Hermanos' involvement in Gus' side business, the fast-food chain presumably shut down. In Breaking Bad's fifth and final season, the company's logo could be shown being removed from Madrigal's list of fast-food subsidiaries as they seemingly cut all ties with Los Pollos Hermanos. There's no word if the company stayed afloat after the disbandment but considering Gus was the owner, it seems unlikely.Madrigal, however, didn't completely stay out of the meth business. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser), an associate of Gus Fring and the Head of Logistics for Madrigal, aligned with Walt to continue her presence in the drug trade. With Gus no longer in the picture, there was no need to use a company to cover up the illegal activity. Lydia allowed Walt, Jesse, and Mike to use Madrigal's warehouse for some of their work.",

        title: "Anthony Mackie's MCU Contract Was Originally For 10 movies",
        shortDescription: "Anthony Mackie originally signed up to a 10-picture deal with Marvel Studios. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a tremendous success, but it simply wouldn't be possible without multi-picture deals. It requires actors to reprise their roles across multiple films, with character arcs that run over the course of years.",
        fullDescription: "Anthony Mackie originally signed up to a 10-picture deal with Marvel Studios. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a tremendous success, but it simply wouldn't be possible without multi-picture deals. It requires actors to reprise their roles across multiple films, with character arcs that run over the course of years.Sooner or later, every contract comes to an end. Marvel recruited many of the OG Avengers under six-film contracts, which became increasingly problematic as the MCU grew. Viewers knew that Avengers: Endgame would be the swan song for the OG Avengers, simply because the contracts had run out. More recently, Marvel's been a lot more secretive about the length of the contracts they've signed actors up with, in order to prevent audiences knowing in advance when an actor was about to bow out. There have been recurring rumors that the contracts have had a quite impressive length, but these have never been confirmed. Mackie's comment gives insight into just how far in advance Marvel Studios likes to operate, and suggests they always had big plans for Sam Wilson. Indeed, it's even possible Marvel had always intended Falcon to become the next Captain America, back when they first hired Mackie for the part. The current wave of Marvel blockbusters appear to be heavily influenced by the comics published between 2010 through to 2014 - Captain Marvel was heavily influenced by Kelly Sue DeConnick's Captain Marvel run, which launched in 2012 - and that was the period where Sam Wilson became Captain America. If so, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige had clearly always been planning to push themes of diversity and inclusion, which were core to Nick Spencer's Captain America: Sam Wilson comics.",

        fullDescription: "Henry Cavill has been confirmed to play the part of Sherlock Holmes in Legendary's Enola Holmes, which stars Millie Bobby Brown as Sherlock's younger sister Enola. In 2006, author Nancy Springer launched a series of young-adult novels starring Sherlock Holmes' 14-year-old sister, Enola, that took advantage of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic characters.Back in March, there were reports that Legendary Pictures had signed up to launch an Enola Holmes film franchise. They'd recruited Millie Bobby Brown to take on the starring role, whose success in Stranger Things has turned her into one of Hollywood's most sought-after young actresses. Enola Holmes is a unique opportunity for Brown, giving her the chance to step up as a major movie actress capable of carrying a franchise. Brown was recently joined by Helena Bonham Carter as Enola's mother, and it seems Legendary is close to rounding out an all-star cast. In recent years, Cavill has become associated with action franchises rather than more cerebral roles; best known for playing Superman in the DC Extended Universe, and also appearing in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Fortunately, though, there's more to Cavill than muscles; as he proved with The Man from U.N.C.L.E., he can pull off suave and charming quite well. It will be interesting to see how Cavill handles the traditionally acerbic Sherlock Holmes, who is after all a Victorian Englishman. Meanwhile, Millie Bobby Brown is certainly going to be busy for the foreseeable future. Stranger Things season 3 is due out on July 4, with the Duffer brothers working on what may be a final fourth season. Brown was also reportedly offered a lead role in Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair, although that's yet to be officially confirmed.",

Per THR, McFeely and Markus will appear in a \"spotlight panel\" celebrating their work on the massive Marvel hit. Their panel is scheduled for Comic-Con's second day, Friday, July 19, and will be moderated by Jeff Goldsmith, who is known for his podcast The Q&A With Jeff Goldsmith. Friday will be an all-Marvel morning in Hall H, as Avengers: Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo will also have a panel. That conversation will be led by Steven Weintraub of Collider. In addition to writing Avengers: Endgame, McFeely and Markus also collaborated on all three Captain America films, as well as Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Infinity War. Their Marvel connection extends off the big screen, too; they also co-created the critical darling Agent Carter for ABC. Outside of the MCU, the two worked on all three Chronicles of Narnia films. McFeely and Markus are beloved by Marvel fans, especially for their work on Captain America: The Winter Solider, and they're also to thank for much of the MCU's impressive continuity across films.",

Seinfeld was beloved by critics and audience members alike; its final season averaged over 38 million viewers. It also won 10 Primetime Emmy Awards and was nominated for 68 throughout its run. In addition to David and Seinfeld, it starred Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards, all of whom have continued to work steadily since the show's conclusion. Louis-Dreyfus starred in The New Adventures of Old Christine and VEEP, while David went on to create and star in Curb Your Enthusiasm. Seinfeld, meanwhile, has found success with Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, a web series and talk show where he chats with fellow comedians. According to Deadline, The Seinfeld Experience is \"part retail shop and part immersive show promotion\" and features \"interactive exhibits with costumes, memorabilia, set re-creations, and props.\" It will also have unspecified new content and a store that sells \"limited-edition and exclusive merchandise.\" The experience comes from both entertainment producer Superfly and Warner Bros. Consumer Products. Tickets will go on sale in the next few months and will be available until February 2020.",

Final Fantasy has recently had a few different crossovers with live-action bits, with the latest coming from a bizarre but entertaining ad for Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers that saw Tom Holland training as a Warrior of Darkness under the tutelage of Hannibal Buress. The Final Fantasy series is known for its varied cast of characters, magical worlds, steampunk-inspired airships and giant, loveable chickens known as Chocobos. The franchise has 15 different official instalments and a number of spin-offs, and frequently invents new worlds with each iteration of the series, giving the new television show plenty to draw from in terms of source material. Over the past few years, Final Fantasy XIV, which boasts over 16 million subscribers, has been a bigger focus for developer Square Enix's attempts to break out into other forms of media, with the Netflix series Dad of Light surprising fans with its quality take on how MMORPGs can bond father and son. According to a report from The Hollywood Reporter, Jason F. Brown (The Expanse), Sean Daniel (The Mummy franchise) and Dinesh Shamdasani (Bloodshot) will produce the show for Hivemind. Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton will write for the series and also serve as executive producers. The new Final Fantasy live-action TV series will apparently incorporate characters and aesthetic from across the franchise, and while details about the new series are scarce, it will apparently explore \"the struggle between magic and technology in a quest to bring peace to a land in conflict.\"",

Starring Karl Urban, The Boys depicts an R-rated world where superheroes have spiraled out of control and only a group of steroid-fueled eccentrics are capable of keeping them violently in check. Initially running on the SyFy network, The Expanse was cancelled after 3 seasons. After backlash from fans, The Expanse was quickly picked up by Amazon, who have made the entire series available for streaming and are set to premiere season 4 later this year. The science fiction series has been widely praised by critics and appears to have found a stable new home. With the star power of Cara Delevingne and Orlando Bloom, Carnival Row is already attracting attention and promises to mix fantasy elements with a neo-noir murder mystery plot. These three shows will form the basis of Amazon Prime's presence at SDCC 2019. Amazon have revealed that there will be immersive, interactive activation experiences inspired by each series, complete with live performers and exclusive parties. Amazon's SDCC lineup also includes a fan premiere of The Boys and a series of panels that will include Bloom, Delevingne and Urban, as well as stars from other Amazon properties such as The Man In The High Castle and Undone. SDCC attendees should be able to find the Amazon Prime Video Experience easily enough by heading towards a giant 40-foot tower with LED screens showing scenes from the platform's upcoming releases.",

It sees Peter Parker and his school friends head out on a field trip across Europe - one that is swiftly interrupted by Nick Fury, super-spy. The Spider-Man: Far From Home trailers set up the school trip pretty well by establishing Peter's excitement at going on vacation. They included shots of Peter visiting Mr. Delmar's Deli, his picking up his passport (in a delightful tongue-twister moment that surely required some reshoots) and even Spider-Man taking down a group of crooks before bantering with the police. It's disappointing to see these scenes wind up on the editing room floor; they looked quite entertaining, were clearly filled with character moments, and also featured some innovative uses of webbing that have never been seen on the big screen before. For all that's the case, though, in thematic terms the cuts make sense. This Spider-Man film is all about taking Peter Parker out of his natural environment, which means a lengthy sequence back in New York just wouldn't quite fit thematically.",

Considering the link between the shows, fans are hoping that they see the two worlds collide before the pioneering series goes off the air. Sadly, it doesn't seem like it's in the cards, at least according to Korsh. One of the original cast members of Suits, Torres exited the series in the middle of season 7 for personal reasons. She maintained a great relationship with her former co-workers, however, even popping in a couple of times now just to check Harvey (Gabriel Macht) and the team over at New York. Since her name was taken down from the wall, there's very little that's been revealed about what she's been up to in Chicago - only that the complications of hiring Mike (Patrick J. Adams) continue to haunt her in the Windy City and force her to join the mayor's team. In just a few more weeks, fans will finally learn how she's been coping with her new life, at the same time that her ex-crew in the Big Apple begin wrapping up their story. Speaking with TV Line in light of the back-t0-back premier for Suits season 9 and Pearson, franchise creator Korsh was asked about the possibility of an original character permanently transferring to the spin-off. He's apprehensive about this, at least right now. Instead, he's keener on a crossover through a specific arc. In any case, he's keeping the door open for any narrative opportunity that would allow them to do either of these possibilities.",

        fullDescription: "HBO is bringing Game of Thrones: The Complete Collection to audiences this holiday season, with plenty of exclusive bonus features. Although the series came to an end just a few weeks ago, and with no small amount of controversy or complaints amongst the viewership, it’s a good bet that even the most causal Game of Thrones fan would like to get their hands on the complete collection, if for nothing else than to have present it in the shadow box the set comes packaged in.

The extras might be worth it for the die-hard Thrones fan, as anyone who watched the series likely has an HBO subscription and therefore has access to the series with the click of a button. If, however, some viewers canceled their subscription after the series finale, but would still like to watch the series at their leisure, it’s hard to pass up the lure of physical media. Check out some pics of the set along with a breakdown of the exclusive extras below.",

        fullDescription: "The new Saw movie will begin filming by the end of this month as revealed on social media by director Darren Lynn Bousman. In May, it was revealed that Chris Rock conceptualized the new story. Created by James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the Saw franchise debuted in 2004. Tobin Bell stars as the conniving John Kramer aka Jigsaw, a man suffering from an inoperable tumor who “inspires” various people by testing them with deadly games. The original Saw film was a massive financial success, as it was produced for just $1 million and topped $100 million at the box office. The aforementioned Bousman was enlisted for Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV, all of which were wildly successful as well. After three more franchise installments released between 2008 and 2010, the Spierig Brothers released the eighth film, Jigsaw, in October 2017. Produced for $10 million, Jigsaw earned $103 million in ticket sales. Now, the latest installment will apparently take the franchise back to its roots. On Twitter, Bousman confirmed that Saw 9 will begin filming this month. The director’s tweet has a nostalgic tone, as he implies that he didn’t anticipate ever working on another Saw film. Bousman also teases the still-untitled project and its horror aesthetics by noting, “Gotta be honest. No one is ready for the insanity about to bleed out on screen!” The new franchise film will be co-produced by Rock, Wan, and Whannell. Meanwhile, both Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg will adapt Rock’s premise for the big screen. The duo previously worked together for Sorority Row, Piranha 3D, Piranha 3DD, and Jigsaw. Check out Bousman’s full tweet below.",

        fullDescription: "Joker reportedly may be eyeing a premiere at the 2019 Venice Film Festival, perhaps to kick off the movie's Oscar campaign. Warner Bros. raised many eyebrows when they announced a standalone Joker origin film that was completely disconnected from the DC Extended Universe franchise (which already had Jared Leto portraying the Clown Prince of Crime). However, more recently the conversation surrounding Joker has swung in a more positive direction. Back in April, WB unveiled the first teaser trailer, giving fans a taste of Joaquin Phoenix's compelling performance. What made the Joker footage stand out when compared to other comic book adaptations is how different it felt. Several viewers noted how reminiscent Joker was of Martin Scorsese classics such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, expressing excitement for a hard-hitting character drama. WB definitely appears confident in what they have, since they could give Joker a premiere on one of film's most prestigious stages. According to Deadline, Joker might receive a fall bow, with Venice a likely option. Both Phoenix and WB have found great success at the Venice Film Festival in the past; the former won Best Actor for his turn in The Master back in 2012, while the latter launched major Oscar contenders Gravity and A Star is Born in Venice.",

Margot Robbie's take on the beloved DC character made her debut in Suicide Squad, and was one of the most widely-praised elements of the otherwise critically-derided movie. Warner Bros. began developing more projects with Harley in mind, starting with Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey movie. Birds of Prey, like Suicide Squad, is an ensemble movie - this time focusing on a trio of Gotham City vigilantes: Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez). They work together with Harley Quinn, who has apparently been emancipated not only from Belle Reve prison but also her relationship with Jared Leto's Joker, to help save a young girl called Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco). With a new lease on life comes a new look, and concept art that emerged online shows Harley sporting shorter hair, bright colors, and her trademark mallet (though it's considerably smaller than the cartoonish comic book version). This is actually a variation on the costume that we saw in the \"See You Soon\" teaser for Birds of Prey, as well as in set photos of Robbie. In the final costume, however, Harley is wearing blue-and-black striped shorts instead of these yellow harlequin overalls, and also a colorful fringed jacket.",

        fullDescription: "For the first time, Godzilla will have a dedicated booth at the San Diego Comic-Con. The iconic kaiju is celebrating his 65th anniversary this year. His most recent cinematic adventure, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, released last month. Godzilla has starred in 35 movies over the course of his 65 year career. Although he was not the first giant monster, Godzilla has remained the most endearing. While King Kong has starred in under 10 movies, Godzilla keeps coming back for more. Since appearing in 1954, the character has been portrayed in different roles, and battled against foes that would go on to become very popular as well, such as King Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla. It can be said that Godzilla changed the landscape for giant monsters in media forever. Without the original 1954 movie, it isn't likely fans would have gotten Rodan, Mothra, Gorgo, or even Ultraman. Simply put, it cannot be overstated how large of an impact the series has had on popular culture. Now, the King of the Monsters will be stomping his way to Comic-Con next month. TOHO Studios, the company behind Godzilla, announced today it will be hosting a dedicated booth to the giant monster at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. A number of activities will be present for fans to engage in. First, there will be a green screen photo booth for \"unique social posts\" using #Godzilla65. There will be \"a live mural painting\" done by Godzilla artist Shinji Nishikawa. (Nishikawa designed a number of monsters in the franchise, such as Kiryu and Grand King Ghidorah.) TOHO will also be featuring the actual suit used in Godzilla 2000, along with props from throughout the movies. Fans will want to save some cash, because there will be SDCC exclusive products. There will also be \"giveaways, photo opportunities and much more gargantuan fun\", according to TOHO.",

The upcoming direct-to-video crossover was announced back in October, and brings together both animated versions of the team. gether both animated versions of the team.The original Teen Titans series premiered on Cartoon Network in 2003. The show quickly became a fan favorite, and developed a dedicated following. It blended serious storytelling, humor, and comic book battles all into five seasons. Despite the show being acclaimed, a sixth season was not produced. However, the show was given a sequel movie in 2006 titled, Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo. A spin-off show titled Teen Titans GO! premiered in 2013. Although it was met with hostility by longtime fans, the show has since acquired a dedicated following as well for its parody humor. Teen Titans GO! likewise received a feature-length movie. Unlike Trouble in Tokyo, Teen Titans GO! To the movies was released in theaters, and did very well for itself. Now, the serious and comedic are about to collide later this year. The official trailer for Teen Titans GO! Vs. Teen Titans has premiered (via IGN), and it shows how the two teams meet up. The antagonists also appear, and it looks like Teen Titans GO! Robin may have some difficulty working with the other team at first. Check out the trailer below.",

The series’ talented ensemble cast has been praised by critics too, in particular the actors playing the younger and older versions of the five wrongly accused, which include Moonlight’s Jharrel Jerome and Caleel Harris (Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween, Castle Rock). It’s not just the critics that are going wild for When They See Us: the series has been a major hit with audiences too. Earlier this month Netflix took to Twitter to announce that since it made its May 31 debut, When They See Us became the streaming giant’s most-watched series in the U.S. Though Netflix is notoriously secretive about its viewership figures, the company seems pretty proud to boast about the number of its subscribers who watched the acclaimed series.",

While Vanderpump thought she was emotionally and mentally prepared to deal with the pressure and drama that comes with being a \"Real Housewife,\" she realized once the season began that it was too much. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star that has been with the franchise since the beginning in 2010 said that this will be her last year. The British restaurateur and former actress was a fan favorite on the show, known for carrying around her little toy dogs dressed up in sparkly attire to match hers. There have been rumors and speculations as to why this original cast member decided to leave The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, but according to her newest interview, viewers may have gotten some answers. During her interview on RuPaul, she reported having a brutal season this year due to the sudden passing of her brother, Mark, who committed suicide in April 2018. She said she felt like she \"wasn't in the right space\" after her brother passed away, adding that she was very close to Mark - her only sibling - who was just 16 months older than her. She previously said that she and her brother were \"more like twins.\" The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star told RuPaul that she wished she'd given herself more time following her brother's death before returning to the show. Even the franchise's creator and executive producer, Andy Cohen, told her on Watch What Happens: Live that he wishes he had given her the year off.",

After being diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer, she was initially hospitalized due to breathing difficulties, and was then placed in a medically-induced coma by doctors. Beth endured a similar situation in April and was rushed to the hospital, though she was sent home shortly thereafter when the issue cleared up. Beth has experienced a long battle with throat cancer, undergoing aggressive chemotherapy after it returned in November. The couple was set to host a new series, Dog's Most Wanted for WGN America, in which a portion of the show would feature her cancer struggle. Beth said that the show’s air date was pushed back to next year. According to TMZ, Beth was rushed to the hospital due to breathing difficulties, where sources said she remained in a medically-induced coma. After arriving at the hospital on the morning of Saturday, June 22, Beth was placed into a medically-induced coma for her own protection. Upon arriving at the emergency room, she experienced severe pain and suffered from lack of oxygen. As she began to receive treatment, it was deemed appropriate to put her under mild sedation, until finally placing her under a medically-induced coma. Her husband revealed that she passed away via his personal Twitter account. Take a look at his tweet below.",

        fullDescription: "Warner Bros. Pictures releases The Good Liar trailer and poster. Based on Nicholas Searle’s novel of the same name, the thriller is directed by Bill Condon. In March 2018, Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren were announced as the leads. Searle released his novel The Good Liar in 2015. Prior to that, he spent 25 years working for British intelligence. The Good Liar explores a conman’s attempts to steal from a wealthy widow. McKellen stars as the scheming Roy Courtnay, and Mirren portrays his victim Betty McLeish. The Good Liar was adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, who previously wrote the 2015 film Mr. Holmes, directed by Condon and starring McKellen. The Good Liar features supporting performances from Russell Tovey (Quantico), Mark Lewis Jones (Chernobyl), Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson (Game of Thrones), Jim Carter (Downton Abbey), and Celine Buckens (Free Rein). Warner Bros. Pictures released The Good Liar’s trailer and poster. The opening focuses on the first meeting between Roy and Betty, this coming after they’d previously conversed online. Both characters discuss their past experiences with online dating, and that perhaps the “next time will be different.” This marks the trailer’s inciting incident, as Roy confesses “a deception” - a seemingly clever way to hide a larger lie. The Good Liar trailer reveals that three million pounds are at stake, and the clip’s first half mostly frames Betty as a naive, lonely woman. In the second half, the drama increases as Roy gets caught up in a game he may not be fully equipped for, with the orchestral sound design upping the suspense even more. As a whole, the trailer’s aesthetics are similar to the recent Netflix release The Perfection, but with industry icons in the main roles. The clip ends with ominous dialogue from Betty, as she references secrets with God, the Devil, and the Dead. Watch The Good Liar trailer and check out the poster below. ",

Even though they've yet to announce their plans for Phase 4 officially, Scarlett Johansson's long-awaited solo movie for Natasha Romanoff is already in production. Black Widow comes after fans around the world saw the character sacrifice her life in Avengers: Endgame so the team could get the Soul Stone, and she was not revived at the end due to the soul-for-a-soul deal being everlasting. Johansson may no longer factor into stories set in the 2023 present day of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Marvel still has plans for her. The solo movie will be a prequel story following Natasha at an unspecified time in her life. Since it is a prequel, though, many have wondered how vital it will be to the larger MCU story. Thanks to new set photos from Black Widow shared on Twitter by @okbanana, we now have our first look at a new costumed character joining the universe. The images are taken from a distance, so the quality isn't the best, but the armored suit is still clear. It appears to be blue and silver primarily with some hints of orange. The face mask completely conceals the identity of the actor playing the role, but the costume design has brought about speculation that it could be the Marvel villain Taskmaster. In addition to his suit, this character also possesses a heavily armored vehicle that can be seen speeding through the streets of Budapest in a set video below.",

Due to hit theaters in less than a week, the Spidey sequel will serve as the final installment of the MCU's Phase 3. The film will be set mere moments after Avengers: Endgame and will explore a post-Iron Man world. Still grieving and attempting to enjoy a typical European vacation with his friends, Peter will be forced by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to partner with Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) to battle The Elementals. Despite his villainous comic book origins, marketing has pitched Mysterio as being a friend and mentor to Peter. In the trailers and TV spots, the film's version of Mysterio claims to be from another Earth. When Thanos managed to complete his goal in Avengers: Infinity War and snap half of all life out of existence, a rift was supposedly opened. Stating that his world was destroyed by The Elementals, Mysterio says he followed one of them through in order to prevent it happening again. Whether or not he reveals himself to be more akin to his comic book counterpart remains to be seen. He's not the only potential villain expected to emerge though. Many believe that Numan Acar's character, Dimitri, will turn out to be Spider-Man's classic foe, Chameleon. Before all of that, however, the new promo posted by Audi USA features Peter dealing with threats much closer to home. Teaming up with his best friend and unofficial 'Man in the Chair' Ned Leeds, Peter heads to school armed with a handmade electric motor. Their excitement regarding their science fair presentation is short-lived, however, when the duo is confronted by the level of their competition. As Ned proclaims, \"One has lasers. One has smoke. One has lasers AND smoke!\" Not to be deterred, however, Peter puts his ever-increasing Spider-Man connections to good use. Check out the full promo below.",

With resumes like that it’s perhaps no wonder Amazon brought Bloom and Delevingne on board the ambitious-looking fantasy series. The series itself marks a change in Amazon’s way of doing things, as the streamer looks to find the next Game of Thrones by seeking out as many high concept, fantasy, or science fiction projects as it can. And while Prime subscribers will have to wait a while before Jeff Bezoz’s enormous investment in The Lord of the Rings begins to pay off, they can busy themselves with the likes of Carnival Row, which looks a bit like Showtime’s Penny Dreadful crossed with Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, with just a bit of Harry Potter thrown in for good measure. The latest teaser showcases the new series’ world building, welcoming viewers to Carnival Row in a video titled ‘Welcome to Carnival Row.’ It’s an effective bit of whimsy that blends some (iffy?) special effects with a train full of fantastical creatures.

And with that, the Yum Brands unit proved once again how much its customers love the brand.The chain started taking reservations at 1 p.m. Eastern on Thursday for the roughly 70 rooms at its Palm Springs hotel Less than a minute after bookings went live, the website was already overwhelmed by the demand. Some users attempting to book a room received a message saying the website was experiencing \"higher than normal traffic\" and to \"keep your crossed fingers on that refresh button.\" Rooms started at $169 per night, with no minimum required stay. The Bell, which is taking over the V Palm Springs Hotel, will open its doors August 8 and close August 12. Taco Bell anticipated high demand for the hotel. The chain's U.S. president, Julie Felss Masino, said that only one employee from a company-owned store will win a coveted room as part of a customer service contest. Guests can look forward to tasting Taco Bell's take on V Palm Springs' restaurant menu, created by Rene Pisciotti, the same product developer who invented Nacho Fries. Among the menu options: a grilled chicken Caesar salad that includes croutons crafted out of Mexican rice and chicken marinated in the Nacho Fries' spices. Traditional Taco Bell favorites will also be available.",

        fullDescription: "Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell signed a bill on Tuesday that will enact some of the strictest vacation rental laws Hawaii has seen in more than 40 years. The law will limit bed-and-breakfast rentals (where the owner lives on site) to only 1,715 in Honolulu. According to current estimates from the Honolulu City Council, there are anywhere between 8,000 and 10,000 vacation rentals on Oahu available at any given time. But only 770 of them are legal, licensed short-term rentals. Rentals in resort areas — including Waikiki, Ko Olina and Turtle Bay — will be exempt from the new law. The bill was put into place over changing neighborhood dynamics. “Residents generally voice strong concerns about ‘unhosted’ transient vacation units, particularly when a significant number of transient vacation units are located in the same neighborhood,” lawmakers wrote in the bill. The bill will not punish travelers who choose to stay in illegal b&bs. It’s aimed at fining owners who advertise illegal rentals. These illegal vacation rentals will be found in “digital stings,” Caldwell said at a press conference on Tuesday, according to Honolulu Civil Beat. The operations will start on Aug. 1. At that time, owners of illegal properties will be subject to a $1,000 fine for the initial violation and $5,000 per day after that. \"I’m a little skeptical that they say they are going to enforce,” Tyler Dos Santos-Tam, a member of Hawaii Good Neighbor, a group that opposed vacation rentals, told Hawaii News Now. “I’m willing to be proven wrong. I hope that they go in hard on day one and start cracking down.”",

Unrating Vienna uses genuine feedback on some of the destination’s finest sights to highlight that the opinion of the masses can sometimes be way off the mark - and mislead the overtrusting. One-star reviews of the world’s greatest landmarks have long been an entertaining insight into the likes of TripAdvisor and Google reviews - of Vienna’s 12th century St Stephen’s Cathedral one states “not enough towers”, but the Austrian capital’s tourist board is concerned it is crippling the imagination of its visitors. In the campaign’s promotional material, it asks “why do we value other peoples’ opinion so much?” “Online ratings are not always the right path to take when it comes to looking for relaxation and moments of enjoyment,” Norbert Kettner, managing director of Vienna Tourist Board, said. “[The campaign] is intended to make people sit up and think and trigger broader public discussion.” Other famed sites in Vienna to receive withering feedback online include the Schonbrunn Palace (“have a pint instead”), the State Opera (“the orchestra does not even try”) and the Hofburg (“boring”). The tourist board says visitors should challenge online reviews from unknown travellers and instead find their own way through the city.",

        fullDescription: "The British royal family is well-known for their jetset lifestyle. The entire Windsor crew is constantly on the go on both official royal visits and lavish personal vacation. But, it turns out one royal couple spends way more than the rest on travel. And it’s probably not who you expect. According to the family’s annual financial report, the entire royal family spent £4.6 million of public funds on travel, which equates to about $5.87 million, for the financial year. As Town&Country explained, British taxpayers foot the bill for travel on any official royal visits through the Sovereign Grant. In the report, taxpayers can find information on the cost of individual trips costing more than £15,000, which equates to $18,000. And, according to the report, the royals who went on the most expensive trips in 2018 were none other than Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla. The report notes, their royal tour of the Caribbean in March cost £416,576, or about $530,000. Though it’s kind of easy to see why it was so costly as it included more than 50 engagements on 10 different islands as well as the first royal visit to Cuba.",

They notified police later, telling officers that the couple appeared to be lost at sea. “The operator became worried and contacted other operators in the area to carry out a search but they were not sighted,” the force said. “The Police Marine Unit and the Barbados Coast Guard conducted a search of the area extending as far as the Bridgetown Port but were unable to locate either the couple or the jet ski.” \"I've been calling; I call and call the police, the U.S. Embassy in Barbados, they can't provide me with any answers,\" Suarez's mother, Ninfa Urrutia, told ABC News. \"They haven’t called me back to let me know what I need to do or find out what’s going on with my son.

        fullDescription: "Warner Bros. has revealed the Blu-ray release date for Detective Pikachu, as well as the full set of special features. Starring Justice Smith as the protagonist and Ryan Reynolds as the smooth-talking electric rodent, the Pokémon film released in May to decent reception, and would go on to become the most commercially successful video game movie to date. Detective Pikachu's first trailer excited viewers with its unique, noir-like setting, and faithful adaption of the Pokémon. Video game movies do not have a good reputation in Hollywood, so fans hoped this film would turn the tide and pave the way for more quality adaptions. Although the film may not be doing as well as projected, it has made over $400 million worldwide, and earned a respectable 67% on Rotten Tomatoes. According to a number of critics, the story was mediocre, while Ryme City and the Pokémon themselves were the highlights. The film was a hit with Pokémon fans, but arguably did not leave the desired impact on casual audiences. Back in January, it was reported that a sequel to Detective Pikachu was already being worked on, so it will be interesting to see if it addresses the criticisms of the first film. In the meantime, fans can look forward to sleuthing along with the title character once again when the film becomes available to watch at home starting in July.",

High fashion labels such as Christopher Kane and Raf Simons are known for pushing the boundaries when it comes to dictating sartorial trends. However, several brands take their interpretation of the word luxury to a whole other level, such as Louis Vuitton with the recent release of its £2,000 Jenga-style set. Yes, really.',

From Chanel ping pong paddles to Raf Simons duct tape, here are eight luxury products that are beyond baffling, but still ever-so-slightly appealing. Six months after first announcing plans for its production, Louis Vuitton has now unveiled its "Monogram Tower", which costs £1,960. While the notion of spending almost £2,000 on a glorified Jenga set is highly irrational, you can\'t deny that the set does look very aesthetically pleasing.

Perhaps you can recall Cardi B singing about his famous “red bottoms” in her hit track, “Bodak Yellow”. Louboutin is the man who made rappers, models, actors and, well, everyone else with an interest in fashion, care about the soles of their shoes. The 56-year-old’s designs are instantly recognisable thanks to the lacquered scarlet shade of their “bottoms”.',
        fullDescription: 'Louboutin is undoubtedly one of the most revered and successful shoe designers of all time, with everyone from Beyoncé and Katy Perry to Miley Cyrus and Melania Trump having worn his shoes. People save up for years to buy them (the average pair will set you back £500) and will proceed to refer to their “Louboutins” with such pride of ownership that you’d think they were talking about their first born. Such is the social and cultural reverence surrounding his designs. Now, 29 years into his career, a landmark exhibition of Louboutin’s work is coming to the Palais de la Porte Dorée in Paris in February 2020. The show will see roughly 500 pairs of shoes on display alongside the myriad objects, artworks and personal items that inspired them. Visitors will also be able to take part in immersive experiences that will transport them from the flamboyant theatres of French cabaret into the intoxicating world of David Lynch’s cult neo-noir, Blue Velvet. It might seem like everyone in the public eye has worn a pair of Louboutin’s theatrical and masterful designs.

Not only can eating at the wrong time mess with your circadian rhythms, the air pressure in the cabin affects your digestive system — meaning that in-flight pasta probably won’t reach its final destination until your aircraft does. Noticing that many passengers were avoiding eating during long-haul flights, Fiji Airways devised a new solution to change the way business class passengers dine while traveling.',
        fullDescription: 'The airline is introducing “Dine on the Ground,” which will move the business class in-flight meal service to the airport lounge shortly before takeoff. Passengers will be able to dine on lighter foods — including fruit bowls, paninis, salads, tapas and soups — throughout the flight. The airline told Australian site Traveller that its research showed 31 percent of Australian passengers skipped their in-flight meals to sleep through the flight. As a result, the airline was throwing out 38 percent of its food on board. The service is available on morning and evening flights from the airline’s base in Nadi, Fiji to Australia, Hong Kong, Los Angeles and San Francisco. It’s not new for an airline to offer full dining on the ground and smaller options while in the skies. Earlier this year, United tested a similar concept for overnight transatlantic flights from Washington-Dulles Airport. And many airlines offer full meal service both at their lounges and in their cabins. What is new is an airline moving its full meal service to the ground.',
