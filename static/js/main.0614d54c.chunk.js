The script was nearly complete by June of the next year, and Hawley said that both he and Fox were happy with the result. However, the movie was then reportedly shelved leading up to the acquisition of Fox and its characters by Disney earlier this year. Hawley previously called the movie "a mixture of genres," similar to how Captain America: The Winter Soldier was both a political thriller and a superhero movie. At the time, he also mentioned the film would grapple with Doom\'s morality and question whether he was really a hero or villain. Hawley also called Doom a "fascinating and under-served character" and said that his mission wasn\'t to reboot the Fantastic Four franchise, but rather focus on one character who hadn\'t been explored as much.

We explore the fate of the fast-food chain and how Gus' death affected the business.",fullDescription:"Los Pollos Hermanos was the most popular eatery in Breaking Bad. Of course, the fast-food fried chicken restaurant also served as a front to Gus' meth business. Here's what happened to the restaurant by the end of the series.Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) co-founded Los Pollos Hermanos along with his business partner Maximino Arciniega in the '80s to cover up their dealings in the drug trade. Years later, the fast-food chain had expanded to 14 locations across the American southwest. The company was a subsidiary Madrigal Electromotive, who owned major stake into the chain. Gus eventually became the sole owner of the business and used his role to ramp up his meth distribution. Los Pollos Hermanos played a key role in Gus' illegal business dealings. He even used the company's trucks to transport his product (even though they were proven to be targets of Cartel thugs). As a way to hide his true identity as a drug kingpin, he often worked inside the flagship restaurant. Throughout Breaking Bad, and the prequel series Better Call Saul, Gus would usually request that his colleagues met him at the restaurant. Because of that, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), and Walter White (Bryan Cranston) were avid Los Pollos Hermanos visitors. Gus' thirst for power would go on to lead to his downfall and death in Breaking Bad season 4, but what happened to Los Pollos Hermanos after Gus' death? After Gus was killed, the DEA continued to investigate his empire. With nobody left to cover up Los Pollos Hermanos' involvement in Gus' side business, the fast-food chain presumably shut down. In Breaking Bad's fifth and final season, the company's logo could be shown being removed from Madrigal's list of fast-food subsidiaries as they seemingly cut all ties with Los Pollos Hermanos. There's no word if the company stayed afloat after the disbandment but considering Gus was the owner, it seems unlikely.Madrigal, however, didn't completely stay out of the meth business. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser), an associate of Gus Fring and the Head of Logistics for Madrigal, aligned with Walt to continue her presence in the drug trade. With Gus no longer in the picture, there was no need to use a company to cover up the illegal activity. Lydia allowed Walt, Jesse, and Mike to use Madrigal's warehouse for some of their work.",category:"television",categoryStyle:"bg-pink",image:"../posts/3.jpg"},{id:4,postDay:4,postMonth:"jun",title:"Anthony Mackie's MCU Contract Was Originally For 10 movies",shortDescription:"Anthony Mackie originally signed up to a 10-picture deal with Marvel Studios.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a tremendous success, but it simply wouldn't be possible without multi-picture deals. It requires actors to reprise their roles across multiple films, with character arcs that run over the course of years.Sooner or later, every contract comes to an end. Marvel recruited many of the OG Avengers under six-film contracts, which became increasingly problematic as the MCU grew. Viewers knew that Avengers: Endgame would be the swan song for the OG Avengers, simply because the contracts had run out. More recently, Marvel's been a lot more secretive about the length of the contracts they've signed actors up with, in order to prevent audiences knowing in advance when an actor was about to bow out. There have been recurring rumors that the contracts have had a quite impressive length, but these have never been confirmed. Mackie's comment gives insight into just how far in advance Marvel Studios likes to operate, and suggests they always had big plans for Sam Wilson. Indeed, it's even possible Marvel had always intended Falcon to become the next Captain America, back when they first hired Mackie for the part. The current wave of Marvel blockbusters appear to be heavily influenced by the comics published between 2010 through to 2014 - Captain Marvel was heavily influenced by Kelly Sue DeConnick's Captain Marvel run, which launched in 2012 - and that was the period where Sam Wilson became Captain America.

They'd recruited Millie Bobby Brown to take on the starring role, whose success in Stranger Things has turned her into one of Hollywood's most sought-after young actresses. Enola Holmes is a unique opportunity for Brown, giving her the chance to step up as a major movie actress capable of carrying a franchise. Brown was recently joined by Helena Bonham Carter as Enola's mother, and it seems Legendary is close to rounding out an all-star cast. In recent years, Cavill has become associated with action franchises rather than more cerebral roles; best known for playing Superman in the DC Extended Universe, and also appearing in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Fortunately, though, there's more to Cavill than muscles; as he proved with The Man from U.N.C.L.E., he can pull off suave and charming quite well. It will be interesting to see how Cavill handles the traditionally acerbic Sherlock Holmes, who is after all a Victorian Englishman. Meanwhile, Millie Bobby Brown is certainly going to be busy for the foreseeable future. Stranger Things season 3 is due out on July 4, with the Duffer brothers working on what may be a final fourth season.

Tobin Bell stars as the conniving John Kramer aka Jigsaw, a man suffering from an inoperable tumor who \u201cinspires\u201d various people by testing them with deadly games. The original Saw film was a massive financial success, as it was produced for just $1 million and topped $100 million at the box office.

After three more franchise installments released between 2008 and 2010, the Spierig Brothers released the eighth film, Jigsaw, in October 2017. Produced for $10 million, Jigsaw earned $103 million in ticket sales. Now, the latest installment will apparently take the franchise back to its roots. On Twitter, Bousman confirmed that Saw 9 will begin filming this month. The director\u2019s tweet has a nostalgic tone, as he implies that he didn\u2019t anticipate ever working on another Saw film.

Warner Bros. raised many eyebrows when they announced a standalone Joker origin film that was completely disconnected from the DC Extended Universe franchise (which already had Jared Leto portraying the Clown Prince of Crime). However, more recently the conversation surrounding Joker has swung in a more positive direction. Back in April, WB unveiled the first teaser trailer, giving fans a taste of Joaquin Phoenix's compelling performance. What made the Joker footage stand out when compared to other comic book adaptations is how different it felt. Several viewers noted how reminiscent Joker was of Martin Scorsese classics such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, expressing excitement for a hard-hitting character drama. WB definitely appears confident in what they have, since they could give Joker a premiere on one of film's most prestigious stages. According to Deadline, Joker might receive a fall bow, with Venice a likely option. Both Phoenix and WB have found great success at the Venice Film Festival in the past; the former won Best Actor for his turn in The Master back in 2012, while the latter launched major Oscar contenders Gravity and A Star is Born in Venice.",category:"movie",categoryStyle:"bg-lightblue",image:"../posts/16.jpg"},{id:17,postDay:14,postMonth:"jun",title:"Birds of Prey Image: Harley Quinn's New Look Leaks Online",shortDescription:"Leaked concept art from Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) shows Harley celebrating her newfound emancipation with a new look.

Godzilla has starred in 35 movies over the course of his 65 year career. Although he was not the first giant monster, Godzilla has remained the most endearing. While King Kong has starred in under 10 movies, Godzilla keeps coming back for more. Since appearing in 1954, the character has been portrayed in different roles, and battled against foes that would go on to become very popular as well, such as King Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla. It can be said that Godzilla changed the landscape for giant monsters in media forever. Without the original 1954 movie, it isn\'t likely fans would have gotten Rodan, Mothra, Gorgo, or even Ultraman. Simply put, it cannot be overstated how large of an impact the series has had on popular culture. Now, the King of the Monsters will be stomping his way to Comic-Con next month. TOHO Studios, the company behind Godzilla, announced today it will be hosting a dedicated booth to the giant monster at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. A number of activities will be present for fans to engage in. First, there will be a green screen photo booth for "unique social posts" using #Godzilla65. There will be "a live mural painting" done by Godzilla artist Shinji Nishikawa. (Nishikawa designed a number of monsters in the franchise, such as Kiryu and Grand King Ghidorah.) TOHO will also be featuring the actual suit used in Godzilla 2000, along with props from throughout the movies. Fans will want to save some cash, because there will be SDCC exclusive products.

Detective Pikachu's first trailer excited viewers with its unique, noir-like setting, and faithful adaption of the Pok\xe9mon. Video game movies do not have a good reputation in Hollywood, so fans hoped this film would turn the tide and pave the way for more quality adaptions. Although the film may not be doing as well as projected, it has made over $400 million worldwide, and earned a respectable 67% on Rotten Tomatoes. According to a number of critics, the story was mediocre, while Ryme City and the Pok\xe9mon themselves were the highlights. The film was a hit with Pok\xe9mon fans, but arguably did not leave the desired impact on casual audiences. Back in January, it was reported that a sequel to Detective Pikachu was already being worked on, so it will be interesting to see if it addresses the criticisms of the first film.
