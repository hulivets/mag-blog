The film has faced quite the battle in its journey to the screen. Hawley first announced he was writing the film back in 2017 when Fox owned the character. The script was nearly complete by June of the next year, and Hawley said that both he and Fox were happy with the result. However, the movie was then reportedly shelved leading up to the acquisition of Fox and its characters by Disney earlier this year. Hawley previously called the movie \\\"a mixture of genres,\\\" similar to how Captain America: The Winter Soldier was both a political thriller and a superhero movie. At the time, he also mentioned the film would grapple with Doom's morality and question whether he was really a hero or villain. Hawley also called Doom a \\\"fascinating and under-served character\\\" and said that his mission wasn't to reboot the Fantastic Four franchise, but rather focus on one character who hadn't been explored as much. As far as casting for the leading role, popular TV and movie villain Mads Mikkelsen threw his hat in the ring a couple of years ago.\",\n        category: 'movie',\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-lightblue',\n        image: 'images/posts/1.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 2,\n        postDay: 2,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"War of The Realms: Complete Reading Guide for Marvel's Epic Event\",\n        shortDescription: \"The epic War of The Realms has finally come to an end in Marvel Comics, filled with fights, deaths, rebirths, unforgettable moments, and universal changes that fans will be talking about for years.

Whether or not you're a die-hard Thor fan, or even a Marvel reader, this event is not to be missed--which is why we're here to help with the ultimate War of The Realms Reading Guide and checklist, from start to finish.When the Dark Elf Malekith leads a devastating (and, initially, successful) invasion of Earth, leading an army made up of the worst killers who ever hated Earth or Asgard, the War of the Realms begins. The epic story that follows has been an unprecedented success for Marvel Comics. Most annual comic events struggle to land, and it's easy to see why: it requires a certain strategic skill to create a central narrative, with room for fresh and creative spinoffs and tie-ins. Fortunately, Thor writer Jason Aaron is one of the few comic book writers to possess that skill, making War of the Realms easily the most carefully-constructed event since 2006's landmark Civil War.

We explore the fate of the fast-food chain and how Gus' death affected the business.\",\n        fullDescription: \"Los Pollos Hermanos was the most popular eatery in Breaking Bad. Of course, the fast-food fried chicken restaurant also served as a front to Gus' meth business. Here's what happened to the restaurant by the end of the series.Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) co-founded Los Pollos Hermanos along with his business partner Maximino Arciniega in the '80s to cover up their dealings in the drug trade. Years later, the fast-food chain had expanded to 14 locations across the American southwest. The company was a subsidiary Madrigal Electromotive, who owned major stake into the chain. Gus eventually became the sole owner of the business and used his role to ramp up his meth distribution. Los Pollos Hermanos played a key role in Gus' illegal business dealings. He even used the company's trucks to transport his product (even though they were proven to be targets of Cartel thugs). As a way to hide his true identity as a drug kingpin, he often worked inside the flagship restaurant. Throughout Breaking Bad, and the prequel series Better Call Saul, Gus would usually request that his colleagues met him at the restaurant. Because of that, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), and Walter White (Bryan Cranston) were avid Los Pollos Hermanos visitors. Gus' thirst for power would go on to lead to his downfall and death in Breaking Bad season 4, but what happened to Los Pollos Hermanos after Gus' death? After Gus was killed, the DEA continued to investigate his empire. With nobody left to cover up Los Pollos Hermanos' involvement in Gus' side business, the fast-food chain presumably shut down. In Breaking Bad's fifth and final season, the company's logo could be shown being removed from Madrigal's list of fast-food subsidiaries as they seemingly cut all ties with Los Pollos Hermanos. There's no word if the company stayed afloat after the disbandment but considering Gus was the owner, it seems unlikely.Madrigal, however, didn't completely stay out of the meth business. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser), an associate of Gus Fring and the Head of Logistics for Madrigal, aligned with Walt to continue her presence in the drug trade. With Gus no longer in the picture, there was no need to use a company to cover up the illegal activity. Lydia allowed Walt, Jesse, and Mike to use Madrigal's warehouse for some of their work.\",\n        category: \"television\",\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-pink',\n        image: 'images/posts/3.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 4,\n        postDay: 4,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"Anthony Mackie's MCU Contract Was Originally For 10 movies\",\n        shortDescription: \"Anthony Mackie originally signed up to a 10-picture deal with Marvel Studios.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a tremendous success, but it simply wouldn't be possible without multi-picture deals. It requires actors to reprise their roles across multiple films, with character arcs that run over the course of years.Sooner or later, every contract comes to an end. Marvel recruited many of the OG Avengers under six-film contracts, which became increasingly problematic as the MCU grew. Viewers knew that Avengers: Endgame would be the swan song for the OG Avengers, simply because the contracts had run out. More recently, Marvel's been a lot more secretive about the length of the contracts they've signed actors up with, in order to prevent audiences knowing in advance when an actor was about to bow out. There have been recurring rumors that the contracts have had a quite impressive length, but these have never been confirmed. Mackie's comment gives insight into just how far in advance Marvel Studios likes to operate, and suggests they always had big plans for Sam Wilson. Indeed, it's even possible Marvel had always intended Falcon to become the next Captain America, back when they first hired Mackie for the part. The current wave of Marvel blockbusters appear to be heavily influenced by the comics published between 2010 through to 2014 - Captain Marvel was heavily influenced by Kelly Sue DeConnick's Captain Marvel run, which launched in 2012 - and that was the period where Sam Wilson became Captain America. If so, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige had clearly always been planning to push themes of diversity and inclusion, which were core to Nick Spencer's Captain America: Sam Wilson comics.\",\n        category: 'movie',\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-lightblue',\n        image: 'images/posts/4.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 5,\n        postDay: 5,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"Henry Cavill Cast As Sherlock In Millie Bobby Brown's Enola Holmes\",\n        shortDescription: \"Henry Cavill has been confirmed to play the part of Sherlock Holmes in Legendary's Enola Holmes, which stars Millie Bobby Brown as Sherlock's younger sister Enola.

In 2006, author Nancy Springer launched a series of young-adult novels starring Sherlock Holmes' 14-year-old sister, Enola, that took advantage of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic characters.Back in March, there were reports that Legendary Pictures had signed up to launch an Enola Holmes film franchise. They'd recruited Millie Bobby Brown to take on the starring role, whose success in Stranger Things has turned her into one of Hollywood's most sought-after young actresses. Enola Holmes is a unique opportunity for Brown, giving her the chance to step up as a major movie actress capable of carrying a franchise. Brown was recently joined by Helena Bonham Carter as Enola's mother, and it seems Legendary is close to rounding out an all-star cast. In recent years, Cavill has become associated with action franchises rather than more cerebral roles; best known for playing Superman in the DC Extended Universe, and also appearing in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Fortunately, though, there's more to Cavill than muscles; as he proved with The Man from U.N.C.L.E., he can pull off suave and charming quite well. It will be interesting to see how Cavill handles the traditionally acerbic Sherlock Holmes, who is after all a Victorian Englishman. Meanwhile, Millie Bobby Brown is certainly going to be busy for the foreseeable future. Stranger Things season 3 is due out on July 4, with the Duffer brothers working on what may be a final fourth season. Brown was also reportedly offered a lead role in Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair, although that's yet to be officially confirmed.\",\n        category: 'movie',\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-lightblue',\n        image: 'images/posts/5.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 6,\n        postDay: 6,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"Avengers: Endgame Writers Headlining Hall H Panel At SDCC\",\n        shortDescription: \"Avengers: Endgame has yet to pass James Cameron's Avatar at the box office, though it surpassed another Cameron film, Titanic, only a couple of weeks after its release.

The Final Fantasy series is known for its varied cast of characters, magical worlds, steampunk-inspired airships and giant, loveable chickens known as Chocobos. The franchise has 15 different official instalments and a number of spin-offs, and frequently invents new worlds with each iteration of the series, giving the new television show plenty to draw from in terms of source material. Over the past few years, Final Fantasy XIV, which boasts over 16 million subscribers, has been a bigger focus for developer Square Enix's attempts to break out into other forms of media, with the Netflix series Dad of Light surprising fans with its quality take on how MMORPGs can bond father and son. According to a report from The Hollywood Reporter, Jason F. Brown (The Expanse), Sean Daniel (The Mummy franchise) and Dinesh Shamdasani (Bloodshot) will produce the show for Hivemind. Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton will write for the series and also serve as executive producers.

The Spider-Man: Far From Home trailers set up the school trip pretty well by establishing Peter's excitement at going on vacation. They included shots of Peter visiting Mr. Delmar's Deli, his picking up his passport (in a delightful tongue-twister moment that surely required some reshoots) and even Spider-Man taking down a group of crooks before bantering with the police. It's disappointing to see these scenes wind up on the editing room floor; they looked quite entertaining, were clearly filled with character moments, and also featured some innovative uses of webbing that have never been seen on the big screen before. For all that's the case, though, in thematic terms the cuts make sense.

Given the enduring worldwide popularity of the Hello Kitty brand, it's perhaps surprising that Kitty White, to use the character's proper name, hasn't appeared in a major Hollywood feature film previously. Although the Hello Kitty franchise has branched out into film in its home country of Japan, the brand's first live action English language Hello Kitty movie was announced back in 2015 and earlier this year, New Line Cinema were confirmed to be taking on the project, with Beau Flynn's Flynn Picture Company producing.\",\n        category: 'movie',\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-lightblue',\n        image: 'images/posts/12.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 13,\n        postDay: 11,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"Suits Creator Not Sure About a Potential Pearson Crossover\",\n        shortDescription: \"Franchise creator Aaron Korsh is uncertain about the possibility of a Suits and Pearson crossover.

Sadly, it doesn't seem like it's in the cards, at least according to Korsh. One of the original cast members of Suits, Torres exited the series in the middle of season 7 for personal reasons. She maintained a great relationship with her former co-workers, however, even popping in a couple of times now just to check Harvey (Gabriel Macht) and the team over at New York. Since her name was taken down from the wall, there's very little that's been revealed about what she's been up to in Chicago - only that the complications of hiring Mike (Patrick J. Adams) continue to haunt her in the Windy City and force her to join the mayor's team. In just a few more weeks, fans will finally learn how she's been coping with her new life, at the same time that her ex-crew in the Big Apple begin wrapping up their story. Speaking with TV Line in light of the back-t0-back premier for Suits season 9 and Pearson, franchise creator Korsh was asked about the possibility of an original character permanently transferring to the spin-off. He's apprehensive about this, at least right now. Instead, he's keener on a crossover through a specific arc. In any case, he's keeping the door open for any narrative opportunity that would allow them to do either of these possibilities.\",\n        category: 'television',\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-pink',\n        image: 'images/posts/13.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 14,\n        postDay: 12,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"Game of Thrones: The Complete Collection Blu-ray Set Available In December\",\n        shortDescription: \"HBO is bringing Game of Thrones: The Complete Collection to audiences this holiday season, with plenty of exclusive bonus features.

In May, it was revealed that Chris Rock conceptualized the new story. Created by James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the Saw franchise debuted in 2004. Tobin Bell stars as the conniving John Kramer aka Jigsaw, a man suffering from an inoperable tumor who “inspires” various people by testing them with deadly games. The original Saw film was a massive financial success, as it was produced for just $1 million and topped $100 million at the box office. The aforementioned Bousman was enlisted for Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV, all of which were wildly successful as well. After three more franchise installments released between 2008 and 2010, the Spierig Brothers released the eighth film, Jigsaw, in October 2017. Produced for $10 million, Jigsaw earned $103 million in ticket sales. Now, the latest installment will apparently take the franchise back to its roots. On Twitter, Bousman confirmed that Saw 9 will begin filming this month. The director’s tweet has a nostalgic tone, as he implies that he didn’t anticipate ever working on another Saw film. Bousman also teases the still-untitled project and its horror aesthetics by noting, “Gotta be honest. No one is ready for the insanity about to bleed out on screen!” The new franchise film will be co-produced by Rock, Wan, and Whannell. Meanwhile, both Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg will adapt Rock’s premise for the big screen. The duo previously worked together for Sorority Row, Piranha 3D, Piranha 3DD, and Jigsaw.

Warner Bros. raised many eyebrows when they announced a standalone Joker origin film that was completely disconnected from the DC Extended Universe franchise (which already had Jared Leto portraying the Clown Prince of Crime). However, more recently the conversation surrounding Joker has swung in a more positive direction. Back in April, WB unveiled the first teaser trailer, giving fans a taste of Joaquin Phoenix's compelling performance. What made the Joker footage stand out when compared to other comic book adaptations is how different it felt. Several viewers noted how reminiscent Joker was of Martin Scorsese classics such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, expressing excitement for a hard-hitting character drama. WB definitely appears confident in what they have, since they could give Joker a premiere on one of film's most prestigious stages. According to Deadline, Joker might receive a fall bow, with Venice a likely option. Both Phoenix and WB have found great success at the Venice Film Festival in the past; the former won Best Actor for his turn in The Master back in 2012, while the latter launched major Oscar contenders Gravity and A Star is Born in Venice.\",\n        category: 'movie',\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-lightblue',\n        image: 'images/posts/16.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 17,\n        postDay: 14,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"Birds of Prey Image: Harley Quinn's New Look Leaks Online\",\n        shortDescription: \"Leaked concept art from Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) shows Harley celebrating her newfound emancipation with a new look.

With a new lease on life comes a new look, and concept art that emerged online shows Harley sporting shorter hair, bright colors, and her trademark mallet (though it's considerably smaller than the cartoonish comic book version). This is actually a variation on the costume that we saw in the \\\"See You Soon\\\" teaser for Birds of Prey, as well as in set photos of Robbie.

It can be said that Godzilla changed the landscape for giant monsters in media forever. Without the original 1954 movie, it isn't likely fans would have gotten Rodan, Mothra, Gorgo, or even Ultraman. Simply put, it cannot be overstated how large of an impact the series has had on popular culture. Now, the King of the Monsters will be stomping his way to Comic-Con next month.

A spin-off show titled Teen Titans GO! premiered in 2013. Although it was met with hostility by longtime fans, the show has since acquired a dedicated following as well for its parody humor. Teen Titans GO! likewise received a feature-length movie. Unlike Trouble in Tokyo, Teen Titans GO! To the movies was released in theaters, and did very well for itself. Now, the serious and comedic are about to collide later this year. The official trailer for Teen Titans GO! Vs. Teen Titans has premiered (via IGN), and it shows how the two teams meet up.

Searle released his novel The Good Liar in 2015. Prior to that, he spent 25 years working for British intelligence. The Good Liar explores a conman’s attempts to steal from a wealthy widow. McKellen stars as the scheming Roy Courtnay, and Mirren portrays his victim Betty McLeish. The Good Liar was adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, who previously wrote the 2015 film Mr. Holmes, directed by Condon and starring McKellen. The Good Liar features supporting performances from Russell Tovey (Quantico), Mark Lewis Jones (Chernobyl), Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson (Game of Thrones), Jim Carter (Downton Abbey), and Celine Buckens (Free Rein). Warner Bros. Pictures released The Good Liar’s trailer and poster. The opening focuses on the first meeting between Roy and Betty, this coming after they’d previously conversed online. Both characters discuss their past experiences with online dating, and that perhaps the “next time will be different.” This marks the trailer’s inciting incident, as Roy confesses “a deception” - a seemingly clever way to hide a larger lie. The Good Liar trailer reveals that three million pounds are at stake, and the clip’s first half mostly frames Betty as a naive, lonely woman. In the second half, the drama increases as Roy gets caught up in a game he may not be fully equipped for, with the orchestral sound design upping the suspense even more. As a whole, the trailer’s aesthetics are similar to the recent Netflix release The Perfection, but with industry icons in the main roles. The clip ends with ominous dialogue from Betty, as she references secrets with God, the Devil, and the Dead.

Stating that his world was destroyed by The Elementals, Mysterio says he followed one of them through in order to prevent it happening again. Whether or not he reveals himself to be more akin to his comic book counterpart remains to be seen. He's not the only potential villain expected to emerge though. Many believe that Numan Acar's character, Dimitri, will turn out to be Spider-Man's classic foe, Chameleon. Before all of that, however, the new promo posted by Audi USA features Peter dealing with threats much closer to home. Teaming up with his best friend and unofficial 'Man in the Chair' Ned Leeds, Peter heads to school armed with a handmade electric motor. Their excitement regarding their science fair presentation is short-lived, however, when the duo is confronted by the level of their competition. As Ned proclaims, \\\"One has lasers. One has smoke. One has lasers AND smoke!\\\" Not to be deterred, however, Peter puts his ever-increasing Spider-Man connections to good use.

Contract issues were to blame for the holdup in renewal, and the massive deal will ensure that Rick and Morty is on the air for many years to come. An episode count for season 4 hasn't been announced yet, but seasons 2 and 3 were 10 episodes each, with season 1 having 11. Leading up to the show's third season finale, co-creator Dan Harmon said he was hoping for a 14 episode fourth season. The third season was initially supposed to be 14 episodes as well, but Harmon and his team worried that the quality of the show would suffer if they went over 10. \",\n        category: 'television',\n        categoryStyle: 'bg-pink',\n        image: 'images/posts/26.jpg'\n    },\n    {\n        id: 27,\n        postDay: 23,\n        postMonth: 'jun',\n        title: \"Carnival Row Teaser Trailer: Orlando Bloom Finds Himself In A Victorian Fantasy\",\n        shortDescription: \"The latest teaser trailer for Amazon Prime’s upcoming Carnival Row takes viewers into a Victorian fantasy.

The the series stars Orland Bloom and Cara Delevingne, two actors who are familiar to fantasy worlds, having starred in The Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Suicide Squad, and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets between them. With resumes like that it’s perhaps no wonder Amazon brought Bloom and Delevingne on board the ambitious-looking fantasy series. The series itself marks a change in Amazon’s way of doing things, as the streamer looks to find the next Game of Thrones by seeking out as many high concept, fantasy, or science fiction projects as it can. And while Prime subscribers will have to wait a while before Jeff Bezoz’s enormous investment in The Lord of the Rings begins to pay off, they can busy themselves with the likes of Carnival Row, which looks a bit like Showtime’s Penny Dreadful crossed with Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, with just a bit of Harry Potter thrown in for good measure. The latest teaser showcases the new series’ world building, welcoming viewers to Carnival Row in a video titled ‘Welcome to Carnival Row.’ It’s an effective bit of whimsy that blends some (iffy?) special effects with a train full of fantastical creatures.

But only 770 of them are legal, licensed short-term rentals. Rentals in resort areas — including Waikiki, Ko Olina and Turtle Bay — will be exempt from the new law. The bill was put into place over changing neighborhood dynamics. “Residents generally voice strong concerns about ‘unhosted’ transient vacation units, particularly when a significant number of transient vacation units are located in the same neighborhood,” lawmakers wrote in the bill. The bill will not punish travelers who choose to stay in illegal b&bs. It’s aimed at fining owners who advertise illegal rentals. These illegal vacation rentals will be found in “digital stings,” Caldwell said at a press conference on Tuesday, according to Honolulu Civil Beat. The operations will start on Aug. 1. At that time, owners of illegal properties will be subject to a $1,000 fine for the initial violation and $5,000 per day after that. \\\"I’m a little skeptical that they say they are going to enforce,” Tyler Dos Santos-Tam, a member of Hawaii Good Neighbor, a group that opposed vacation rentals, told Hawaii News Now. “I’m willing to be proven wrong.

In the report, taxpayers can find information on the cost of individual trips costing more than £15,000, which equates to $18,000. And, according to the report, the royals who went on the most expensive trips in 2018 were none other than Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla. The report notes, their royal tour of the Caribbean in March cost £416,576, or about $530,000.

Detective Pikachu's first trailer excited viewers with its unique, noir-like setting, and faithful adaption of the Pokémon. Video game movies do not have a good reputation in Hollywood, so fans hoped this film would turn the tide and pave the way for more quality adaptions. Although the film may not be doing as well as projected, it has made over $400 million worldwide, and earned a respectable 67% on Rotten Tomatoes. According to a number of critics, the story was mediocre, while Ryme City and the Pokémon themselves were the highlights. The film was a hit with Pokémon fans, but arguably did not leave the desired impact on casual audiences. Back in January, it was reported that a sequel to Detective Pikachu was already being worked on, so it will be interesting to see if it addresses the criticisms of the first film.

Passengers will be able to dine on lighter foods — including fruit bowls, paninis, salads, tapas and soups — throughout the flight. The airline told Australian site Traveller that its research showed 31 percent of Australian passengers skipped their in-flight meals to sleep through the flight. As a result, the airline was throwing out 38 percent of its food on board. The service is available on morning and evening flights from the airline’s base in Nadi, Fiji to Australia, Hong Kong, Los Angeles and San Francisco. It’s not new for an airline to offer full dining on the ground and smaller options while in the skies. Earlier this year, United tested a similar concept for overnight transatlantic flights from Washington-Dulles Airport. And many airlines offer full meal service both at their lounges and in their cabins. What is new is an airline moving its full meal service to the ground.',\n        category: 'travel',\n        image: 'images/posts/42.jpg'\n    },\n\n]\n\n\nexport const mainPageFilter = posts.reverse().filter((postId) => {\n    return postId.id !== isNaN ?
